# 100 Days Of Health

This is my second challenge of doing a "100 Days of X" habbit building.

The main goal is to become the identity that I want to be.

**Don't listen to the naysayers**

## Rules

1. Do at least one of the following each day:
	1. 	Cook a healthy meal.
	2. Do exercise
		* Examples: Go for a walk (above taking kids to nursery and back)
		* Body weight (push ups, squats etc.)
		* Weights (kettlebell, free weights etc.)
	3. 	Meditate
2. Take notes and update this log.	
3. Tweet daily progress with the hashtag: #100DaysOfHealth

The challenge would be a failure if I have gone 3 consecutive days without following the rules.
