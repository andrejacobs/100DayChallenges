# 100 Days Of Health

## Log book - Week 8

### Day 50: 9 July 2021

**Today**:

* Did 150 pushups! This is a PB for me.

Did 20, thought this was it for today. Rested 2 minutes. Then did 30, 20, 10, 10, 30, 30 with max about 2 to 3 minutes rest each set.

**Thoughts:** Ironically, it seems the days I least think I have the energy or the will, then I manage some how get a fire lit and reach 100+
