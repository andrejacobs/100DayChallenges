## Log book - Week 1

### Day 1: 21 June 2021

**Today**:

* Practised soldering SMD components
* Watched @drfootleg talk about how he designed and prototyped his PCBs.

**Thoughts:** Paragraph or two

**Key concepts:**

1. KiCad seems very cable of being used to design schematics and PCBs
2. Always double if not triple check the foot print sizes of pads and components
3. I can hand solder 0603 components!
