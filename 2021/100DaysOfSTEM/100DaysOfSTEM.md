# 100 Days Of STEM

21 June 2021

This is my 3rd challenge of doing a "100 Days of X" habbit building.

**What do I want to learn or make?**

Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics:

* Major focus is going to be on Electronics & Mathematics.
* I want to continue keeping my iOS development skills up to date.
* I want to dedicate some time to learning Physics, Chemistry etc.

## Rules

1. Learn about a topic for minimum an hour a day.
2. Take notes if possible and update this log.
3. Tweet daily progress with the hashtag: #100DaysOfSTEM

The challenge would be a failure if I have gone 3 consecutive days without following the rules.

## Log book

* [Week 2](Week2/Week2.md)
* [Week 3](Week3/Week3.md)
