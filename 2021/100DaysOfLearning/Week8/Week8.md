# 100 Days Of Learning

## Log book - Week 8

### Day 49: 26 April 2021

**Today**: Learning about the 8 point grid system and components in Figma.

**Thoughts:** I am now exactly half way through the 100 days challenge.

**Key concepts:**

1. Good to have a minimum of 16 points between elements and the sides.
2. Minimum of 8 points between elements.
3. Every element's dimensions should be divisible by 8 points.
4. In Figma you turn on a layout grid for every frame.
5. Rulers are enabled by `⇧ r`
6. You can create components from frames.
7. Each copy of a component is called an instance.
8. Changes to the component affect all instances.
9. Instances can have customisation applied that only affect that instance. Known as overrides.
10. You can reset an instance (thus removing the overides).
11. Components can be located from the Assets tab.

### Day 50: 27 April 2021

**Today**: Continuing with UI Design for Developers course.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. Drop shadows help to make certain elements feel more important on the screen.
2. Good values for a Drop shadow is to have the Y be 50% of the Blur value. Using Black and opacity between 10% - 25% is also good.
3. iOS uses quite a bit of background blurring. In Figma using a background fill of white with 50% opacity and a background blur of 40 gives a similar result.
4. `⌘ ⇧ v` to paste over selection (i.e. at relative 0,0 of the selected items)
5. I am learning about "containers" in Figma. A lot of repition of doing "Group" and then "Auto Layout".

### Day 51: 28 April 2021

**Today**: Worked through videos 14 - 17 of UI Design for Developers.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. You can change the colour of each character in text.
2. The popular size for icons at the moment is 24 x 24 points. iOS seems to be 28 x 28 but Android is 24 x 24.
3. Press enter to enter into vector editing mode.
4. You can flatten unions, vectors etc. so that transforms like scale can work. You can also Outline Stroke.
5. Figma has a Vector network that is unique to Figma and allows for powerful vector editing.

### Day 53: 30 April 2021

**Today**: Started with the iOS Design Handbook course.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. You can decrease visual hierarchy by assigning the Primary colour and then adjusting the HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness) to have saturation of between 3 - 5 and brightness of between 90 - 100. For example imagine you have 2 buttons, 1 is assigned the Primary colour and the other button is less important.
2. Typography - Baseline is the line on which the characters rest upon (does not include the tails of characters like g,p,q etc.)
3. X-height the distance/space from the baseline to the "average" character height not including the ascender.
4. Descender is the space from the baseline to the bottom of these "tails" i.e. space down to the bottom of the g or p.
5. Ascender is the space from the x-height to the top most portions, i.e. the dot from an i etc.
6. Kerning determines how two characters should be positioned next to each other.
7. Line height should be between 120 - 145% of the font size.
8. Lines should not be more than 45 - 90 characters. Depends on device screen size.
