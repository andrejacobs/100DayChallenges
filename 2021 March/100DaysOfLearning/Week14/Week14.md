### Day 96: 12 June 2021

**Today**: More WWDC.
Watched "Swift concurrency: Behind the scenes" and
"Demystify SwiftUI"

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. Runtime contract guarantees that threads will always make progress.
2. Stack frames are stored on the heap and this allows a thread to replace the current stack for other code to be executed.
3. The thread that executed code before the await is “most” likely not the same thread that will continue after.
4. Avoid branches when creating views in SwiftUI.
