# 100 Days Of Learning

## Log book - Week 3

### Day 14: 22 March 2021

**Today**: Managed to get syntax highlighting working on my blog.

**Thoughts:** I really need to invest some more time in learning Docker so that I can use it to "freeze" a develop environment and that in theory I can just spin up containers in the future and everything "should" just work out of the box.

**Key concepts:**

Most of the key concepts was discovered yesterday.

### Day 15: 23 March 2021

**Today**: Learned about Phantom types in Swift. I also started exploring my options for downloading and storing images for the Lego database learning project.

**Thoughts:** I am more tired than usual today. Regardless I still managed to learn some new things.
Initially I was going to just do the stupid thing and store a BLOB in the database, but why do the simple and wrong thing when you can do the complex and hopefully right thing :-D

**Key concepts:**

1. Phantom type: a type that doesnâ€™t use at least one of its generic type parameters.
2. It is used to build more type-safe APIs.
3. Schedule a function for OpenFaaS is literally just using cron to run faas-cli invoke. Simples.

### Day 16: 24 March 2021

**Today**: Started learning about sqlalchemy-imageattach and alembic

**Thoughts:** I would have loved to have made more progress by now but got disctracted by new shiny objects.
Instead of just deleting the existing database and letting the ORM create the "updated" schema, I want to use a tool or something that can handle these changes to my models. Guess I got a bit spoiled by Django's tools.

However I did discover that the creators of SQLAlchemy created a tool called alembic.

**Key concepts:**
 
1. faasd stores the secrets at: /var/lib/faasd-provider/secrets and it is then binded to /var/openfaas/secrets for the function containers.
2. alembic can be used to manage database migrations of a SQLAlchemy database.
3. Swift: CRLF "\r\n" is treated as a single Unicode character. for c in string ... c == "\r\n"

### Day 17: 25 March 2021

**Today**: Alembic and SQLAlchemy-ImageAttach turned out be a bust for me at this time. Instead I have switched gears and will be just storing the file path in the database once the image has been downloaded.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. SQLAlchemy you can use .filter(Class.property.is_(None)) to check for NULLs.
2. You can also do the invert is_not().
3. To do an AND use and_ to combine expressions.
