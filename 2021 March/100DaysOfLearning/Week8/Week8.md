# 100 Days Of Learning

## Log book - Week X

### Day 49: 26 April 2021

**Today**: Learning about the 8 point grid system and components in Figma.

**Thoughts:** I am now exactly half way through the 100 days challenge.

**Key concepts:**

1. Good to have a minimum of 16 points between elements and the sides.
2. Minimum of 8 points between elements.
3. Every element's dimensions should be divisible by 8 points.
4. In Figma you turn on a layout grid for every frame.
5. Rulers are enabled by `⇧ r`
6. You can create components from frames.
7. Each copy of a component is called an instance.
8. Changes to the component affect all instances.
9. Instances can have customisation applied that only affect that instance. Known as overrides.
10. You can reset an instance (thus removing the overides).
11. Components can be located from the Assets tab.

### Day 50: 27 April 2021

**Today**: Continuing with UI Design for Developers course.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. Drop shadows help to make certain elements feel more important on the screen.
2. Good values for a Drop shadow is to have the Y be 50% of the Blur value. Using Black and opacity between 10% - 25% is also good.
3. iOS uses quite a bit of background blurring. In Figma using a background fill of white with 50% opacity and a background blur of 40 gives a similar result.
4. `⌘ ⇧ v` to paste over selection (i.e. at relative 0,0 of the selected items)
5. I am learning about "containers" in Figma. A lot of repition of doing "Group" and then "Auto Layout".

### Day 51: 28 April 2021

**Today**: Worked through videos 14 - 17 of UI Design for Developers.

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Key concepts:**

1. You can change the colour of each character in text.
2. The popular size for icons at the moment is 24 x 24 points. iOS seems to be 28 x 28 but Android is 24 x 24.
3. Press enter to enter into vector editing mode.
4. You can flatten unions, vectors etc. so that transforms like scale can work. You can also Outline Stroke.
5. Figma has a Vector network that is unique to Figma and allows for powerful vector editing.
