# 100 Days Of Learning

This is my first challenge to kickstart the "100 Days of X" habbit and I chose a generic category of Learning as to not restrict myself to a single topic just yet.

The main goal is to oil the machine, fire it up and keep it running.

**What do I want to learn (more of / not master) during this challenge?**

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Serverless technologies. Starting with [Serverless for everyone else](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)
* Modern iOS technologies like SwiftUI and Combine

## Rules

1. Learn about a topic for minimum an hour a day.
2. Take notes and update this log.
3. Tweet daily progress with the hashtag: #100DaysOfLearning

The challenge would be a failure if I have gone 3 consecutive days without following the rules.
