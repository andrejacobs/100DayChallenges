# 100 Days Of Learning

This is my first challenge to kickstart the "100 Days of X" habbit and I chose a generic category of Learning as to not restrict myself to a single topic just yet.

The main goal is to oil the machine, fire it up and keep it running.

**What do I want to learn (more of / not master) during this challenge?**

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Serverless technologies. Starting with [Serverless for everyone else](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)
* Modern iOS technologies like SwiftUI and Combine

## Rules

1. Learn about a topic for minimum an hour a day.
2. Take notes and update this log.
3. Tweet daily progress with the hashtag: #100DaysOfLearning

The challenge would be a failure if I have gone 3 consecutive days without following the rules.

### Day 0: 8 March 2021

**Today**: Started going through Alex Ellis's book "Serverless for everyone else" and learned about OpenFaaS, faasd and multipass.

**Thoughts:** I actually liked learning about setting up faasd locally on my Mac and deploying my first FaaS (cowsay / ASCII Cows)

**Key concepts:**

1. Kubernetes (a.k.a K8s): Orchestrates container deployment, scaling, and management.
2. FaaS: Function as a Service.
2. OpenFaaS: Makes it simple to deploy both functions and existing code to Kubernetes.
3. faasd: Light-weight way of running OpenFaaS. Not really scalable but still very cool.
4. faasd swaps out Kubernetes for containerd which is a low level container runtime.
5. Multipass: Amazing! How did I not know about this. Super easy way to run Ubuntu instances.

### Day 1: 9 March 2021

**Today**: Signed up to Notion and learned the basics of using Notion. Also managed to setup faas-cli on my Mac and invoke a function.

**Thoughts:** Notion has been on my radar for a while but at face value it looked complicated. I am so glad I took the plunge! This is THE tool I have been looking for. In fact I managed to write the entire blog post in it and export it to markdown and then add to wordpress.

**Key concepts:**

1. Notion is awesome. Just try it!
2. faas-cli can be installed on Mac using brew (I love brew!)
3. faas-cli is pretty easy to setup and start using against faasd
