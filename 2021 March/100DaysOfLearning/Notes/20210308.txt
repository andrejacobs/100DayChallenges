Notes from going through the eBook "Serverless for everyone else"

What is "Helm Charts" and "Arkade tool"
	* Helm: package manager for Kubernetes (https://helm.sh/).
	* Arkade: (https://github.com/alexellis/arkade) Open Source Kubernetes Marketplace. Works with helm charts

What is OpenFaas?
	* Makes it simple to deploy both functions and existing code to Kubernetes
	* Founded by Alex Ellis (https://www.alexellis.io/)
	* Docker based

What is faasd?
	* A server that runs a stack of core OpenFaaS services.
	* A light-weight way of running OpenFaaS.
	* Can not scale beyond one replica and cannot build clusters.

What is Kubernetes?
	* Automated container deployment, scaling, and management
	* a.k.a K8s (the 8 refers to the 8 letters between K and s - Learned from Ana√Øs Urlichs [https://twitter.com/urlichsanais] tips)
	
The PLONK stack (OpenFaaS)
	* Prometheus - a time-series database to capture metrics
	* Linux - OS to provide containers
	* OpenFaaS - management and auto-scaling of functions/micro-services
	* NATS - asynchronous message bus / queue for deferred execution
	* Kubernetes - declarative, extensible, scale-out, self-healing clustering

What is multipass?
	* Amazing! Made by Canonical and is an easy way to spin up Linux VM https://multipass.run/

faasd swaps out Kubernetes for containerd which is a low level container runtime.

Next actions:
* Install Multipass on my mac
* Follow the video workshop from Alex and get faasd installed on the Multipass instance
