Today's agenda
* Take a small detour by learning about using Notion. Why? So that I can take better notes and share it with other people.
* Install faas-cli and explore it a bit.

Notion

* Type / and then you can choose a block type (e.g. Heading 2, bullet list)
* Pages can have sub pages (infinitely)
* Highlight text to get a styling menu
* Blocks can be reordered by dragging the ::
* You can build templates to make it easier to add new pages
* Can do Kanban boards with the Task List template
* Has the concept of a Database view. Spreadsheets++
* Can import markdown, html, csv etc.
* Powerful Sharing and permissions are available
* Can Export to markdown, PDF etc. <-- LOVE THIS!

Action points

Watch Thomas Frank's video about how he uses Notion (this is what led me to wanting to learn Notion, also lots of people use it [like AnaÃ¯s])
