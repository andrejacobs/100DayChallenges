### Day 44: 20 April 2021

**Today**: Started the course "UI Design for Developers" by designcode.io

**Thoughts:** I am really enjoying learning about Figma and I can see why so many UX & UI people use it.

**Key concepts:**

1. Figma can import Sketch files.
2. Figma has a ton of community design files.
3. Frames can be nested inside of each other. Just drag and drop.
4. Keyboard shortcuts:
	* `a` Lets you choose a common size frame (e.g. iPhone 11)
	* `⌘ +` and `⌘ -` to zoom in and out.
	* `⇧ 2` to zoom in on the selected frame.
	* `o` creates a circle and `r` creates a rectangle.
	* `⌥`held down allows to see distances between elements.
	* `⌘ click` to directly select the element regardless of grouping etc.
	* `⌘ D` Duplicate elements or `⌥ drag` elements. You can hold down `⇧` to get better spacing.
