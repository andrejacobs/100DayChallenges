# 100 Days Of Decluttering and Organising

It is time to clean up and organise my home, work space and shed.

A cleaner environment would lead to a clearer and more creative mind.

## Rules

1. Spend a few minutes to a few hours decluttering or organising my "environment".
2. Allowed to build solutions for organisation (e.g. wood working)
3. Keep a log of what is being done.
4. Tweet weekly progress with the hashtag: #100DaysOfDecluttering and #100DaysOfOrganising
