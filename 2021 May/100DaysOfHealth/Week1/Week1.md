# 100 Days Of Health

## Log book - Week 1

### Day 1: 21 May 2021

**Today**:

* Got my first Covid 19 vaccine
* Meditated for 5 minutes
* Did 20 push ups

**Thoughts:** Today is the first day of feeling 99% after having just had a cold that turned into bronchitis. My arm hurts a little bit after the vaccine.
